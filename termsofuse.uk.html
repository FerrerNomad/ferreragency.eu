                    <h1>Conditions of services <br><br>Building and maintaining websites</h1>
                    <p class="priv-text">The websites operate on a subscription system called "Software as a Service", belonging to Ferrer Digital Agency and are associated with an activation fee and monthly subscription agreed with each client. All websites created and hosted

                        migration of the website and all associated services to a new server will be the customer's responsibility. After 15 days of cancellation of services, the website(s) in question will be deleted from Ferrer's system and server Digital

                    <h1>Google Ads </h1>
                    <h2 class="title-priv">Definition</h2>
                    <p class="priv-text">Google Ads is a sponsored advertising technique that can boost the access and sales of your virtual store. It occurs when users find and click on paid ads on search engines, social media, and other partner sites, leading them directly
                        to your e-commerce page.</p>
                    <p class="priv-text">Unlike organic traffic, which depends on the production of content optimized for SEO, Google Ads requires investment in advertising campaigns. Despite this, it offers advantages such as agility in generating access and visits to the
                        virtual store. While organic traffic can take months to generate results, Google Ads can generate instant access.</p>
                    <p class="priv-text">Therefore, Google Ads can be an efficient strategy to immediately increase the visits and sales of your virtual store.</p>
                    <h2 class="title-priv">Customer Responsibility</h2>
                    <p class="priv-text">Being aware that there is no guarantee of expected results or expected time.</p>
                    <p class="priv-text">Knowing that there are other factors that can influence the desired sales outcome, such as a good landing page for your target audience, effective communication channels, quick response times, and sales skills of employees who interact
                        with end-users.</p>
                    <h1>Social Media Management and Digital Marketing </h1>
                    <p class="priv-text">The client is responsible for providing information about the business so that the strategy can be developed. It is the customer's responsibility to send photographs of the establishment/products for content creation, unless the images
                        are obtained from image banks. The client is also responsible for approving publications prior to publication. Only after approval will publications be published.</p>
                    <p class="priv-text">If the customer chooses to subscribe to a digital marketing service or advertising campaigns, it is his responsibility to invest in advertising in the selected media, unless an offer or campaign is agreed in the contract signed by
                        both parties. The client must also approve the campaigns before they are published. Ferrer Digital Agency is not responsible for delays in communication by the client.</p>
